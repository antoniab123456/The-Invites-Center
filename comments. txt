Folders and url extentions

Routes are the js files that identify which views to trigger when you add a path to a url like '/info'
 files that identify routes are set in the main js file( in this case app.js)
   this info in app.js: 'var routes = require('./routes/index');---- sets a variable for tje file that will identify the route for the slash sigh
var users = require('./routes/users'); ' ------set variables for the route that will identify the route for the /users sign
   this info: app.use('/', routes); ------ says that your app will use the "/" sign for the routes variable( that as we know was set to the js file routes/index)
app.use('/users', users);  --------- says that your app will  use  "/users" for the users variable( that was set to the js file routes/user)*/ 

//to sum up, in the app.js file we have a paragraph where we set variables for the FILES that will indentify a path var called routes = should lead us to the js file  require('./  in the folder routes/ index')


//now we want this var to be identified as / so we
//app.use('/', routes);

//now we need to set the view in the file itself
//router.get ('/', function(req, res){
//res.render('index');
//  });
